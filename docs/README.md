# PySH Documentation

This directory is the **single source of truth** for all PySH project documentation.
GitHub Wiki may mirror selected pages in the future; it is not an independent second
source of truth. All canonical documentation lives here under `docs/`.

## GitHub Wiki mapping

The GitHub Wiki is **not** used as an independent documentation source.
If Wiki pages are created in the future, they will mirror or link to content
in this `docs/` tree. Content is authored here and synced to the Wiki; the
Wiki is never the authority.

Suggested future Wiki structure when mirroring is implemented:

| Wiki page | Source |
| --------- | ------ |
| `Home` | `docs/README.md` (this file) |
| `Installation` | `docs/user/installation.md` |
| `Builtins` | `docs/user/builtins.md` |
| `Configuration` | `docs/user/configuration.md` |
| `Migration` | `docs/migration/migration.md` |
| `Architecture` | `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` |

---

## Source-of-truth policy

1. `docs/` is the single source of truth for all project documentation.
2. The root `README.md` is a project introduction and links into `docs/`.
3. `docs/README.md` (this file) is the canonical documentation index.
4. GitHub Wiki, if used, may mirror selected pages from `docs/` but must
   never become an independent second source of truth.
5. Documentation must not be duplicated into divergent copies across the tree.
6. All compatibility and feature claims in documentation must be backed by
   tests or the current test matrix. Aspirational claims are not permitted.
